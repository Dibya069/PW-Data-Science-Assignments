    " - Object classification is the task of assigning a single label or category to an input image or object. It involves determining what object is present in an image, but it does not provide information about where the object is located within the image. \n",
    " - Object classification is a fundamental building block in many computer vision applications and can be approached using various machine learning algorithms, including traditional techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and more advanced methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\n",
    " - Object Classification Example:\n",
    "    - Imagine you have a dataset of images containing various animals, and your goal is to classify each image into one of several animal categories.\n",
    "    - In this case, the task of object classification is to correctly identify and label this image as a \"cat.\"  it only needs to determine the class of the main object in the image.\n",

    " -  In object detection, multiple objects of different classes might be present in an image, and the task is to both classify the objects and provide bounding boxes that tightly enclose each object.\n",
    " - Object Detection Example:\n",
    "    - Now, consider a different scenario where you have images with multiple objects, and you want to both classify and locate each object. \n",
    "    - In this case, the task of object detection involves identifying and localizing all the objects in the image.\n",
    "    - Identify the objects: Detect that there's a dog, a bicycle, and a person present in the image.\n",
