    "- The main difference between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, is that Elastic Net overcomes some of their limitations. Ridge Regression only shrinks coefficients towards zero but does not perform variable selection, while Lasso Regression can perform variable selection but may select only one variable among a group of highly correlated variables.

By evaluating the performance of the model on different subsets of the data, cross-validation helps determine the combination of alpha and l1_ratio that yields the best trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance. Grid search or randomized search can be used to explore different combinations of alpha and l1_ratio values within specified ranges and find the optimal values based on a chosen evaluation metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared."
