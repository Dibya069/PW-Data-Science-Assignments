    "- Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    " - In traditional web hosting, the website or web application is hosted on physical servers owned and managed by the hosting provider.\n",
    " - The server resources, such as CPU, RAM, and storage, are dedicated to the website or application.\n",
    " - Scaling resources can be challenging and may require manual intervention or migration to a more powerful server.\n",
    " - The pricing structure is often based on fixed plans or contracts.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Cloud Hosting:\n",
    " - Cloud hosting utilizes virtual servers hosted on a cloud platform provided by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    " - The servers are virtualized and share physical resources among multiple customers, offering scalability and flexibility.\n",
    " - Resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, allowing for cost optimization and improved performance.\n",
    " - Cloud hosting offers various services like load balancers, auto-scaling, and managed databases, simplifying infrastructure management.\n",
    " - Pricing is typically based on usage, allowing customers to pay for the resources they consume."
