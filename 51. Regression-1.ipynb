    "- Simple linear regression is a regression model that examines the linear relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. It assumes a straight-line relationship between the variables and estimates the slope and intercept of the line. An example of simple linear regression is predicting house prices based on the area of the house.\n",
    "- Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, involves multiple independent variables. It examines the linear relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It estimates the coefficients of the independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable. An example of multiple linear regression is predicting a person's income based on their age, education level, and years of experience."
