    "1. Non-linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Without non-linearity, the neural network would be limited to representing linear functions, severely restricting its modeling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient Flow: During backpropagation, the gradients are propagated through the network to update the weights. The choice of activation function affects the gradient flow and can impact how well the gradients propagate through the network. If the gradients vanish or explode, it can hinder the learning process. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and promote better gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Capacity: Different activation functions have different characteristics that affect the model's capacity to represent complex functions. Some activation functions, like sigmoid or tanh, compress the input space, while others, like ReLU, allow for unbounded outputs. The choice of activation function can influence the expressive power and flexibility of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Convergence Speed: Activation functions can affect the convergence speed of the training process. Some activation functions, such as ReLU, have faster convergence rates compared to others. Faster convergence can reduce the training time and make the network more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Output Range: The range of values that an activation function produces as outputs can impact the behavior and stability of the network. Activation functions like sigmoid and tanh squash the outputs within a limited range, which can make the network more sensitive to small changes in input. Activation functions like ReLU provide unbounded outputs, which can introduce numerical stability issues if not properly controlled."

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing Gradient: The sigmoid function is prone to the vanishing gradient problem. As the absolute value of the input increases, the gradient of the sigmoid function approaches zero, which slows down the learning process. Deep neural networks with many layers using the sigmoid activation function can suffer from vanishing gradients, making it challenging to train the network effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Saturation: The sigmoid function saturates at the extreme ends of the input range, causing outputs to be close to 0 or 1. When the network is in the saturated regime, the gradients become small, which can slow down the learning process. This is particularly problematic during initialization or when the network encounters inputs far from the training distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biased Outputs: The output of the sigmoid function is biased towards the extreme values of 0 and 1. This can result in imbalanced predictions when the inputs are near these extremes. It may lead to slow convergence and difficulty in learning appropriate representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Range Limitation: The output of the sigmoid function is limited between 0 and 1, which can cause the activations to be compressed or squashed, especially for large or small input values. This can limit the expressive power of the network, as it cannot produce unbounded output values."
