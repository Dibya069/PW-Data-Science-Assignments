    "- Ridge Regression, also known as L2 regularization, is a regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function. This penalty term is the L2 norm of the coefficient vector multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda). Ridge Regression differs from ordinary least squares regression by including the regularization term, which helps to control the complexity of the model and mitigate overfitting. \n",

Cross-validation involves evaluating the performance of the model on different subsets of the data for different lambda values. The goal is to find the lambda value that achieves the best trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search can be used to explore a range of lambda values and select the one that yields the best performance based on a chosen evaluation metric, such as mean squared error or R-squared."

If feature selection is a priority, Lasso Regression or Elastic Net Regression, which incorporate L1 regularization, are better suited."
