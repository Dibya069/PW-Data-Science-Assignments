    "- Boosting can handle large datasets with many features without overfitting, making it suitable for complex real-world problems.\n",
    "- Boosting can also identify the most important features for a particular prediction problem, allowing you to focus on the most relevant factors.\n",

    "- Boosting may overfit the data if the base learner is too complex or if the number of iterations is too high.\n",
