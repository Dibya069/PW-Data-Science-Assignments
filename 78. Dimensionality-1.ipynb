As a result, overfitting can occur, where the model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

This sparsity can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to learn meaningful patterns and relationships in the data, leading to poor performance.\n",
    "- Increased computational complexity: As the number of dimensions increases, the computational complexity of machine learning algorithms also increases exponentially, making it difficult to process and analyze large datasets in a reasonable amount of time. This can limit the scalability of machine learning models and make them impractical for real-world applications.\n",
    "- Increased risk of overfitting: As the number of dimensions increases, the risk of overfitting also increases. This is because the high-dimensional feature space provides more opportunities for the model to fit noise in the data, rather than meaningful patterns. This can result in a model that performs well on the training data but performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "- Difficulty in feature selection: As the number of dimensions increases, it becomes more difficult to select the most relevant features for the model. This is because there may be many irrelevant or redundant features that can hinder the model's performance. Feature selection algorithms can help address this issue, but they can also introduce their own biases and limitations."
